how to remember for loop syntax
[vara]=any variable
sequence used list ,tuple ,range etc
for [var] in sequence: 


while Loop
The "while" loop continues to execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. It's often used when you don't know in advance how many times the loop should run
eg while (kubectl get deploy):
  print ("pod name ")
