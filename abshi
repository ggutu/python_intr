Local Scope: Variables defined within a function have local scope and are only accessible inside that function.[c]
Global Scope: Variables defined outside of any function have global scope and can be accessed throughout the entire code.[a,b]
a = 2
b = 4
def addition():
    c = 5
    print(a + b  + c)
def sub():
    print(a - b)
sub()--------------2
addition()--------------11
=================================
Naming convention variable always important, define variable in lower case
1.lower case
eg name "Gutu
   Name "Hawi"
print(name)
print(Name) XXXXXXX wrong 
2. ec2instance not best practice
ec2_instance
